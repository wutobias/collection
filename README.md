# collection
This is a collection of various bash and python scripts. A short description
of a script can be obtained by executing it without any arguments. Most of
these were written in the context of my research (University of Marburg, UC
San Diego) and therefore do various things in the context of computer
simulations of biomolecules, protein structures and binding thermodynamics.
In case you find a bug (which is not unlikely) or have ideas to improve something, please let me
know!
